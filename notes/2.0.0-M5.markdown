Changes since M4:

* statika and aws-statika is now integrated as one project
* restructured project packages, now only two imports needed:

    ```scala
    import ohnosequences.statika._
    import ohnosequences.statika.aws._
    ```
* Added a constructor for building instructions from a `ProcessBuilder` (withouth `workingDir` management)
