- Removed direct shapeless dependency
- Everything related to the "tower" of dependencies is removed
- Dependencies are now managed as plain lists of `AnyBundle`s
- Distributions are renamed to _environments_
- A new witness-based approach for recording that an environment can apply a bundle correctly
- Rewrote instructions part: declaring instruction steps statically, then running them
- statika and aws-statika are now integrated as one project. Now only two imports needed:

    ```scala
    import ohnosequences.statika._
    import ohnosequences.statika.aws._
    ```
