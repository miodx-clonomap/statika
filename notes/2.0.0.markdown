This is a major release, because it introduces breaking changes.

- Removed direct shapeless dependency
- Upgraded code to the cosas v0.6.0 release
- Moved to the package naming convention as in ohnosequences/cosas
- Everything related to the "tower" of dependencies is removed
- Now a bundle has only a typeset of direct dependencies and for installation it uses an untyped list
- Bundle with default empty install method is called a _module_
- Distributions are renamed to _environments_
